	h2 Why responsible investment is important for M&amp;G
	p At M&amp;G we are stewards of our clients’ assets, and we take seriously the responsibilities that come with this role. Watch this video to find out what responsible investment means for M&amp;G, why we believe it is so important and how we put our responsible investment principles into practice. The value of investments will fluctuate, which will cause fund prices to fall as well as rise and you may not get back the original amount you invested.

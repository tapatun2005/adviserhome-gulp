			p At T. Rowe Price, we have one business – investments, and one purpose – to help our clients confidently achieve long-term financial success.
			p Founded in 1937 during the Great Depression, T. Rowe Price is built on the enduring philosophy of our founder – meeting clients’ individual needs. For over 80 years and through changing investment and economic environments, the core principles that guide our business have remained the same.
			p As a global investment manager, we actively listen, anticipate and develop investment strategies that align to the needs of our clients. For over 80 years this has directed the evolution of our investment capabilities across equity, fixed income and multi asset and led to a broad range of strategies across capitalisations, sectors, styles and regions. Each strategy is supported by our proprietary global research platform and experienced investment teams.
